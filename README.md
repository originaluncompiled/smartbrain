# SmartBrain

SmartBrainâ„¢ is an A.I. Face Recognition system. It detects and highlights all the faces in an image.

The Final [ZTM](https://zerotomastery.io/) *Complete Web Developer* Project

#### Differences Compared to the Course:
- Multi-Face support;
- Tells the user when they've, *for e.g.*, entered the wrong email and password;
- Face counter;
- Inability to spam buttons (User has to wait for a request to return before sending another);
- Keyboard shortcuts for certain actions - like pressing the *"Detect Faces"* button;
- A (in my opinion) better design.
